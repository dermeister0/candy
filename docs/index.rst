From day to day developing using .NET standard library sometimes you get in idea in mind "that little feature would be useful to have in all my projects". It could me just few lines of code you keep repeating around. Usually in that cases we do *Helpers classes that migrate from project to project.

We tried to collect such little things in one place to be able to use it in all projects. Also we focused to have good documentation that would list all helpers and where these can be used.
